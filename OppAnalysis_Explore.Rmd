QUESTIONS

HOW DO YOU MAKE A CHART BIGGER?

HOW DO YOU FILTER ggplot FOR SPECIFIC VALUES?

HOW DO I FIND AND REMOVE/CORRECT OUTLIER

TOO MANY VALUES - HOW DO I PARE DOWN / REDUCE SO PLOTS DONT LOOK OVERPOPULATED?

What is overall WON AND CLOSED, vs. DROPPED and LOST?

What is overall WON AND CLOSED, vs. DROPPED and LOST - by YEAR?

What is overall WON AND CLOSED, vs. DROPPED and LOST - by INDUSTRY?

What is overall WON AND CLOSED, vs. DROPPED and LOST - by TERRITORY?

What is overall WON AND CLOSED, vs. DROPPED and LOST - by PARTNER or INSIDE? by TERRITORY?


Are there INDUSTRIES where CLOSED is more common than LOST

How does ENERGY compare to the other industries

For the CLOSED deals, what are the high, low, and mean for the revenue?

Organized by INDUSTRY?


WE DONT HAVE TERRITORY - HOW DO WE GET?
Organized by TERRITORY?
Do some TERRITORIES do better at CLOSING deals than others?
Do some TERRITORIES do better at CLOSING deals in ENERGY?
How do they companre with other industries?

WHen do deals get WON AND CLOSED or LOST during a financial Quarter?
